/*
A)
one is: ['one']
two is: ['two']
three is:['three]

You can change the value inside the arryas but you cannot change what value the variable is pointing to

b)
one is: ['two'];
two is:['three];
three is: ['one'];

this time we are changing the value inside the array and not the array itself 

C)

one is: ['two']
two is:['three];
three is: ['one'];

with the splice method we ask to change the value of the array at index 0 which leads to the above result
