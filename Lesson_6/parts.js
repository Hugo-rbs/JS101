// keeping score & best to five (best player out of 5 games)//

/*
What do we need - 
1. a way to keep the score after each round is played / this needs to be printed on the screen 

1. keeping track of the score: 
- set a ROUND_TO_PLAY: 5
- use the detectWinner function to increment the Player or Computer score
- use the someoneWon function to decrement the number of rounds to play
- if the number of round played is equal to round to play stop
- show the score and grandWinner
- reset the score 
- new game? 

*/

// incrementing the player or computer score //
/* 
we need to store the result somewhere increase it and print it at each round;
- to store it, we can store it in an object:
score = {
  Player : 0;
  Computer : 0,
}
- we can create a function to increase the score in the object accordingly
- console.log to print it
